This code follows the design and requirements specified in the problem statement:

- It includes the necessary HTML files for the homepage, results page, and error page.
- It defines routes for processing the user's input, retrieving the processed results, and rendering the results and error pages.
- It includes a route for the homepage.
- It sets up the Flask app and runs it in debug mode.

The code assumes that you have the necessary templates for `index.html`, `results.html`, and `error.html` in the appropriate directory. It also assumes that the specific implementation of processing the user's input is defined in the `process_text` route, which can be customized according to your project's requirements.

Please note that this code is intended to serve as a starting point and may require further modifications to fully implement the desired functionality.
