## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: This file serves as the homepage of the application. It should include a form containing a text input field and a button for submitting the user's input. The form's action should point to the `process_text` route.
- **results.html**: This file will display the results of processing the user's input. It should initially be empty and only display content after the form in `index.html` is submitted.
- **error.html**: This file will display an error message if there is a problem processing the user's input. It could include a concise explanation of the error and instructions for resolving it.

### Routes

- **process_text**: This route will handle the form submission from `index.html`. It will receive the user's input as a parameter and perform the necessary processing. Depending on the results of the processing, it can redirect to either `results.html` or `error.html`.
- **get_results**: This route will be used to retrieve the processed results from the server and display them in `results.html`. The frontend can make an AJAX request to this route to fetch the results, and the route will return JSON data containing the formatted results.

### Usage

1. When a user visits the homepage (`index.html`), they will see a simple form with an input field and a submit button.
2. The user enters the text they want to process into the input field and clicks the submit button.
3. The application sends the user's input to the `process_text` route, which performs the necessary processing.
4. The `process_text` route redirects the user to either `results.html` or `error.html`, depending on whether the processing was successful or not.
5. If redirected to `results.html`, the frontend makes an AJAX request to the `get_results` route to fetch the processed results in JSON format.
6. The frontend uses the JSON data to populate the `results.html` page, displaying the processed results to the user.

### Additional Notes

- The design assumes you have a Python Flask application already set up, with the appropriate imports and configurations.
- The specific implementation of the processing logic in the `process_text` route will depend on the requirements of your specific problem.
- Feel free to adjust the HTML files and routes according to your project's requirements and user experience preferences.
